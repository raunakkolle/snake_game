# snake_game

A simple snake game using javascript and html.
The snake's directions can be controlled by the user in order to achieve it's goal of consuming the fruit.
 
 what needs to be updated?
  Current version of this project contains a single snake, hence when this snake moves outside the specified arena, 
  the game haults and cannot proceed further.
  
  The snake is allowed to hit its own body without any issues, but according the traditional snake game the game must
  end when it hits or comes in contact with itself.
  
  Variations to the maze can be esatblished, such as building a maze with walls. 
  This makes the game more challenging for the player.
